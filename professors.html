                                <h4>Artist, Creative thinking and composition teacher</h4>
                                <p>Yulia Kazakova came to Berlin to enter the College of Fine Arts (UdK) after she had graduated from a college of fine arts in Moscow. «In Russia the classical academic school is very strong and fundamental. Almost all the students, which have graduated the primary fine art school in Russia, can draw, know anatomy and the color theory well. However, in spite of this, many entrants of the European universities coming from ex-Soviet countries or Asia meet some problems during the portfolio preview which are rooted in the differences in requirements in Europe and Russia/Asia.</p>
                                <p>If in Russian educational approach it’s more important to have good techniques in terms of Realism in drawing still life, plaster models, human body, objects in perspective, in German university all these skills are payed less attention which is reallocated to higher-valued creative thinking, painter’s ideas and social relevance of art”.</p>
                                <p>Yulia is a painter and is teaching at the School of Arts ans Design. The projection of industrial aesthetics on the socialy significant themes is the main motive in Yulia’s creative world. In Yulia’s works visual effects collaborate spectacularly with flat/plane and “volume” items, objects of reality are opposed to abstract things. The composition of Yulia’s works is multidimentional and complex and is built on the repetition or mixture of different elements, specific pieces of industrial architecture.</p>
